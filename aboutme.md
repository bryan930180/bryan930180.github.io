Hey there! I'm Bryan. Let me tell you more about myself.

I'm a data scientist who contemplates about topics that are relevant to medicine and inspire people to dig deeper or just simply fun. I am primarily interested in neuroscience, data science, machine learning, public health, and health policy. I'm currently taking a gap year before entering medical school.
<!-- Beginning in September 2020, I'll be doing research at ... lab in Boston, MA. -->

### What I've done

I did my undergraduate at Boston University (2020) and graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics (Statistics) and Biology (Specialization in Cellular Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics) with a minor in Economics - I know, a mouthful. I loved being in Boston because of the density of ideas that are exchanged around there, especially in medicine. While there, I was the chair of the Allocations Board and I worked directly with the Dean of Students to allocate over $700,000 annually to 300 clubs that request funding. You can think of us like the FED of Boston University. We worked with club presidents and treasurers to help them secure funding and helped coordinate campus-wide or club-specific events.  It was a really fun experience talking to club presidents and treasurers and discussing their needs, while I get to see the diversity of the student body.


### What interests me

I knew I wanted to do medicine from the beginning, but the complexity of biology had to be addressed systematically. Therefore, I got my start in statistics during my undergrad. After taking Linear Models, I learned about how large datasets can be handled and analyzed. I was surprised to learn the theories that underlie many of the commonly heard buzzwords i.e. Machine Learning, Regression, Big Data. I was also intrigued by neuroscience because of its capacity to be modeled. After I learned about its intimate connection with mathematics, I wanted to learn more about how we can simulate the various functions of neural circuits. I'm also interested in public health and health policy because of its relevance to society today. I hope to work on giving people the treatment they need. After all, that's the goal of medicine!

I worked with Professor Eric Roseen in the BU School of Medicine Department of Family Medicine on the effects of non-pharmacologic methods on psychometric measures. This project is a secondary data analysis on the Back To Health clinical trial with over 320 participants. The manuscript for which I am hoping to publish in the coming months.

<!-- ### Where I've been

I love travelling and exploring new places! Some highlights include:

* Living and working in Brussels, Belgium at [Dalberg Data Insights](https://www.dalberg.com/what-we-do/dalberg-data-insights), summer 2019
* Living and conducting research on non-communicable diseases among sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya
* Debating at the World University Debating Championships in The Hague, Netherlands (2017), Mexico City (2018), and Cape Town, South Africa (2019). Also debating at Oxford and Cambridge!

### Where I'm going

This summer I'll be working as a Data Science intern at Facebook in New York City. In the medium-to-long-term I hope to be able to further explore my interests in data science for social good, whether that be in media/politics, sustainability, global health, or social/economic inclusion. -->

### Where are you from?

I was born in Los Angeles, CA, but I quickly moved to Taipei, Taiwan. I spent 18 years here so that is where I call home! My parents are both Taiwanese but they met while they were studying abroad in the US. I have an older brother that is 7 years older than I am.

### What I do in my free time

I've been playing the violin since I was seven years old. I have some unlisted videos that I am too shy to post here. :) Although I no longer play, my love for classical music is on-par with my interest in medicine. My favorite piece is Mozart's Piano Concerto No.23 in A major II. Andante. I enjoy going to a good concert now and then. I also love other genres such as Rock, Jazz, Rap, and K-pop. I can talk on and on about this.

I also love biking and basketball. I do it leisurely and I use the bike to get around the city. Saves time!
