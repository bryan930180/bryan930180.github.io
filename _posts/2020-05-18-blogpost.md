Hello, world!

I decided to start this blog as a way of jotting down some daily thoughts I have, and share the projects I've been working on, both academically and for fun. Here, I want to showcase my interests in different disciplines and all the while weave in my personality a bit more. On a CV or Resume, employers can only see projects that I do under a formal setting. However, I wouldn't be able to communicate spontaneous ideas that I have. I want to fill this blog with random things that pique my interest such as writing an opinion piece or an interactive *shiny* app. Most importantly, I want to use this blog to increase online presence and allow collaborators to see the different domains of work that I am interested in.

That being said, I hope you enjoy browsing through my website! If something I have written here interests you do not hesitate to start a discussion with me. If there is something you disagree with feel free to let me know! Please reach out to me if you are a potential collaborator or simply a like-minded fellow! I'm always down to chat and grab coffee if we're in the same area.
